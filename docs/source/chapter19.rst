I also had the same issue at first but I have found the solution...

Step 1

Download the following RAR file from the link below;
https://drive.google.com/open?id=10gwrG9uTDwaEO-7EudsmBkfgdcyrcABI

Step 2

Once downloaded, extract these and copy the content within the "update" folder (not the "update" folder itself just the content inside it)

Step 3

Paste content to the following path on your computer...
C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Arduino

Step 4

Restart Arduino IDE Software

Open Arduino IDE, select your COM port if required and Select your WAVGAT board type (WAVGAT boards are at the very bottom of the board list)
